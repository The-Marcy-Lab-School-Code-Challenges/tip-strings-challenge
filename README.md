**Problem Description**

Write a function that prints the first `n` Fibonacci numbers using **only variables and a loop** — no arrays needed. 

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. The sequence begins:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...

**Example**

```jsx
printFibonacci(5);  // should print 0, 1, 1, 2, 3
printFibonacci(10); // should print 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34
```
